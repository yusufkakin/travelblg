    <p class="backgrounds1 animate__animated animate__shakeX">I was in Budapest for a month for a volunteering project in 2015 sponsored by European Union! We were volunteering from different countries such as UK, Lithuania, France, Spain and Russia to teach Hungarian children English and practice. Our project was mainly in a city called Szeged but I had the opportunity to travel many surrounding countries close to Hungary.

    <p class="backgrounds1 animate__animated animate__shakeX">I really fell in love with the city of Budapest and the European architecture as well during my stay. We would walk many hours and get tired but if I have the chance to go back now I definitely would go back again.
